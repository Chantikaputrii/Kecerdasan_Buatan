- [x] Create src/feature_engineering.py with:
  - New feature creation: age bins, blood pressure difference, cholesterol category
  - Data transformations: scaling numeric features, encoding categorical features
- [ ] Test the feature engineering functions on cleaned dataset
- [ ] Integrate feature engineering into data pipeline or modeling script
- [ ] Validate feature impact on model performance
